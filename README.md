### 5.2 Back - end
Currently, the `server` directory is reserved for future back - end development. It is not in use at present.

## 6. Code Example: BookList.vue
The `BookList.vue` component is responsible for displaying the book list. Here is its code:
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>üìö Âõæ‰π¶ÂàóË°®</h2>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="book in sortedBooks.slice(0, 10)" :key="book.id">
        <strong>{{ book.title }}</strong> ({{ book.publishYear }}) by <em>{{ book.author }}</em> - ÈòÖËØªÈáè: <span class="read-count">{{ book.readCount }}</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, onMounted, computed } from 'vue';
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
  setup() {
    const books = ref([]);

    onMounted(() => {
      axios.get('/api/books') 
        .then(response => {
          // Ensure the data structure is correct
          if (response.data && response.data.books) {
            books.value = response.data.books;
          }
        })
        .catch(error => console.error("Ëé∑ÂèñÂõæ‰π¶ÂàóË°®Â§±Ë¥•", error));
    });

    const sortedBooks = computed(() => {
      return books.value.sort((a, b) => a.id - b.id);
    });

    return { books, sortedBooks };
  }
};
</script>

<style scoped>
.read-count {
  color: #ff6347;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```
### Explanation
- **Template**: Displays the book list in an unordered list. It shows the book title, publication year, author, and read count.
- **Script**:
  - Uses Vue 3's Composition API.
  - Fetches book data from the `/api/books` API when the component is mounted.
  - Sorts the books by their ID using a computed property.
- **Style**: Sets the color and font - weight of the read count.
